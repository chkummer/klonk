#Electronics 
This folder contains schematics and board files. To create these file we used Fritzing (http://www.fritzing.org/).
There are some subfolders reflecting different types of Klonk:
* klonk_rfid_rc522_green_led: (initial/old) version with just one single colored LED indicatitng ready-state
* klonk_rfid_rc522_rgb_led: multicolored LED (green = ready / red = locked / blue = setup)

You may order your PCB within the fritzing.org Application or export to Gerber and order form your preferred PCB manufaturer. If you prefer to make your PCB yourself you may:
* etch your PCB
* CNC mill your PCB (Videos: [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/208966549) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/cIODuNZz-OE))
